# Getting Started

1. run `. ~/.file/bin/install.sh`
2. next you'll have to symlink everything to the proper place (I'll automate this later...just open `install.sh` and copy paste)
3. reboot terminal and you'll be good to go
4. tip, for os specific things utilize a `.zshrc_local`
5. also install `nvim` if you're privy
